First, we need read the ASF [[official doc](https://community.apache.org/newcommitter.html)](https://community.apache.org/newcommitter.html) to know the basic need for new committer, then we could refer such like other ASF projects's [[article](https://linkis.incubator.apache.org/community/how-to-vote-a-committer-pmc/)](https://linkis.incubator.apache.org/community/how-to-vote-a-committer-pmc/)

Then we could gather some info in `GitHub/Dev Mail/JIRA...` and list them in **English** (Text only, dont't include pictures)
